<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->


# react-portfolio-lk

## description
this react App is a portfolio showcasing my projects and skills in building single-page applications.

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

This portfolio using new React skills, which will help set you  apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

## Getting Started

You’ll use `vite` to build your portfolio, which will include the following:

* A single `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Navigation` component within the header that will use `Link` components from `react-router-dom` to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

* A single `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
### When you would like to scaffold a new `vite` application on your own, follow these steps

1. In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run `npm create vite@4.4.1`.

    * 🔑 *Note*: This command will automatically create a sub-folder which will house your React application; you do not need to perform a `mkdir` command to create one manually.

2. Enter the desired name of your new project folder.

3. From the first list of options, select your framework; for our activities in class, we'll be using `React`.

4. From the second list of options, select your variant; for our activities in class, we'll be using `JavaScript`.

5. `cd` into your newly created project folder and run `npm install`.

    * In later activities we'll add additional NPM packages to our `vite` apps such as 'bootstrap', 'dotenv', and 'axios'.

6. Run `npm dev`/`npm run dev` and navigate to the prompted URL to see your app.

### Further customization (Recommended)

1. Navigate to your `package.json` and modify the `scripts` object so that it looks like this example:

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },

  * Note the addition of the `"start": "vite"` script.

2. Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this

js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true
  }
})
